1. As the quantity of hidden nodes rises, there is a potential rise in accuracy. This leads to an increase in the necessary training data and training time. The network improves its ability to grasp input data patterns, but there is also a chance of overfitting.

2. Accuracy generally improves with the expansion of hidden units; however, there's a threshold beyond which adding more units might not significantly enhance results or could potentially cause a minor performance dip due to overfitting or other considerations.
