1D convolution is a technique used to identify edges in an image by sliding a small filter along a single dimension, often horizontally or vertically. This filter, designed to detect changes in pixel intensity, responds strongly to sudden shifts from low to high intensity values. As the filter traverses the image, it computes a new signal by multiplying its coefficients with the corresponding pixel values at each position and summing them up. The resulting signal highlights regions where significant intensity changes occur, effectively pinpointing edges within the image. By applying appropriate thresholding to this signal, the detected edges can be emphasized, aiding in various image processing tasks like object detection and boundary delineation.
