Increasing the number of epochs can lead to an increase in validation error due to overfitting. As the model trains for more epochs, it becomes excessively specialized to the training data, even capturing noise and outliers. This causes the model's performance to degrade on unseen validation data. To prevent this, techniques like early stopping, dropout, and regularization can be employed. Early stopping involves monitoring the validation error and halting training when it starts increasing, thus preventing the model from overfitting. Regularization techniques, like adding penalty terms to the loss function, constrain the model's complexity and discourage it from fitting noise.

Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) converges faster than batch Gradient Descent (GD) by leveraging the advantages of both methods. Batch GD computes gradients using the entire dataset, resulting in stable but slow updates. Pure SGD updates on a single data point, leading to noisy updates and slow convergence. Mini-batch SGD strikes a balance by utilizing small subsets of the data, combining frequent updates with reduced noise. This enables efficient utilization of parallel processing, speeding up convergence and allowing the algorithm to find a better solution in a shorter time.
